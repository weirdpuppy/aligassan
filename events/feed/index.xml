<h3>Program Description</h3>



<p>Classical Oil Portraiture emphasizes the structural characteristics of the face that are most responsible for likeness, but goes on to explore the chromatic characteristics of facial complexion. In addition, students will learn how capturing the “personality” of the sitter, not merely a likeness, results in more engaging paintings. This is achieved through class lectures on facial structures and features as well as facial anatomy.<br>Students will begin with an initial drawing, mapping out the important proportions of the head and features, and will transfer the drawing to their painting, eliminating any need for adjustments in measuring to take place in the painting process. Students will then do a small color poster study of their model to determine broad color mixtures and variations in values and color chroma. We can now begin to paint with greater awareness and confidence in portraiture. More time will then be given to achieving personality and expression of the sitter as color relationships and proportions are now an established foundation of a successful portrait painting.</p>

<h3>Program Description</h3>



<p>Alla prima is a painting technique, used mostly in oil painting, in which layers of wet paint are added to previously applied layers of wet paint (wet-on-wet). Capturing the figure believably in oil paint can be a difficult task, but doing it in one sitting may seem impossible. Yet this is exactly what we will be doing in this workshop. You will embark on the journey of learning about oil paint and practicing accurate color mixing, values, and forms of the model to help develop your ability to paint alla prima.</p>
